 * settling/analysis — analytical reads of settled carriers.
 *
 * Analysis is downstream of settlement: it reads extrema and derived geometry
 * (exact arithmetic, graded sectors, finite relation-graph Laplacians,
 * first-order conservation reads, spectral root structure, differential
 * controls) without defining the primitive carriers it analyzes.
 *
 * The public package handle is `@lenticule-science/articulating/predicating/positing/settling/analysis`. The same namespace
 * is also available from the root import as `analysis`.
 *
 * This surface is carrier-valued and exact. It is useful for reading relation
 * geometry, spectral root-location judgments, harmonic and conservation
 * witness/obstruction data, charged control findings, and evidence
 * distributions after settlement, but it is not a drop-in floating-point
 * numerical library.
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 * import * as analysis from "@lenticule-science/articulating/predicating/positing/settling/analysis";
 * import { chargeValue } from "@lenticule-science/articulating";
 *
 * const n = analysis.count(["a", "b", "c"]);
 * n.kind; // "exactNumber.natural"
 *
 * const distribution = analysis.chargeDistribution([
 *   chargeValue("potential"),
 *   chargeValue("active"),
 *   chargeValue("stable"),
 * ]);
 *
 * analysis.evidenceCoordinates(distribution).kind;
 * // "meme-analysis.evidence.coordinates"
 *
 * // `section` is a SectionCarrier from settlement.
 * const graph = analysis.relationGraph(section);
 * analysis.harmonic(graph, [analysis.ratZero, analysis.ratZero]).kind;
 * // "meme-analysis.laplacian.harmonic:witness"
 *
 * // `matrix` is an exact integer Matrix.
 * analysis.pisotRoot(analysis.charPoly(matrix)).kind;
 * // "spectral.pisotRoot:witness"
 *
 * const network = analysis.conservation.flowNetwork(section);
 * analysis.conservation.conserved(network, network.edges.map(() => analysis.ratZero)).kind;
 * // "meme-analysis.conservation.conserved:witness"
 * ```
